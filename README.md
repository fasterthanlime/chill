# chill

A friend of mine showed me Ruby code and we were both drunk
so I wrote bad Go code to show off.

## How to use

The GUI version is probably the most fun, so, if you have a working install of Go 1.11 or something:

```
go get github.com/fasterthanlime/chill/...
chillgui http://jazzblackmusic.ice.infomaniak.ch/jazzblackmusic-high.mp3
```
